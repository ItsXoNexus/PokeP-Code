There was a loud crash in front of him and he hid behind the closest tree. Butterfree came out when the dust cleared. \"Now where does that Charmander live?\" she asked herself. Charmander whimpered and shuddered. Butterfree spotted his tail and flew toward him. At that moment, Charmander realized that there was a small bit of reluctance in Butterfree. Then he realized why. Bug-type Pokémon are weak against fire-type! Charmander gained all the courage he could and looked Butterfree in the eye. Butterfree cowered back and flew away never to be seen again. Charmander was safe because he had shown courage in scary times.", "Vulpix was eating her berries happily on a nice little hill that she liked to call home. She lived by two trees, who stood tall no matter what happened. But that all changed when Frosmoth came along. Frosmoth was in search for a fire-type Pokémon to defeat. This would show how amazing Frosmoth was because ice is weak against fire. Defeating someone your weak against is hard. Frosmoth wanted to win a challenge. Frosmoth froze innocent bystanders and froze Vulpix's trees. Vulpix whimpered. Frosmoth heard this and was ready for battle. Vulpix, however, was not! \"At last! A fire-type pokémon to battle! Vulpix, come out, come out where ever you are!\" Frosmoth said. Finally, Vulpix showed herself! Vulpix was going to be fair, by letting Frosmoth go first. Frosmoth used Blizzard! Blizzard was weak against Vulpix, so Vulpix was didn't loose much health. Vulpix used Ember right after that and Frosmoth fainted!
